As I'm crunching through the Deep Learning course at Coursera, I've decided to broaden my Deep Learning knowledge. In the Coursera forum, people were mentioning this book at lot. 

[Deep Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618) is a comprehensive guide about Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It provides the math background regarding the main methodologies used in both. On the other hand, it provides the smooth transition from Machine Learning to Deep Learning. 

The book is essential for anyone who is deeply interested in this area. I've bought hardcover since I wanted to have this copy for my book collection.
